Wow, I love it!
Some fun on Apple's XCode


## Ex1 - Simple application 

Very simple application, just a little start, nothing special.

## Ex2 - Swift vs Objective C size comparison

The same application has been written in Obj-C and Swift just to compare the executables sizes. Of course Swift application are bigger, how bigger they are is actually a surprise.
