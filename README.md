# Apple
Wow, I love it!
Some fun on Apple's XCode

I'm recording some videos on Mac OS programming because to program an Apple is always a pleasure. I started this because there is so few of this amazing machine. I remember when Apple designed floppy disk with constant linear velocity, meanwhile the world was using the constant angular velocity. On Apple's floppy disk drivers, the inner tracks had a higher angular velocity and external track a lower one. This allowed storing more information. The best I like of Apple is this "escape from money constraint", yes these wonderful pieces of hardware are not for all. I have not their last model and I'm using an old iMac from mid 2011, but yet today it is something more than a "pc", it's really something mystic. 
Apple is not the computer you see in the movie, it is not the computer for rich, for me, it is how the computer should be made.  I was 16 when started to dream Apple, I bought my first Apple product on 2008, when I was 38 and finally got my iMac at 45. 
I'm not doing this because I have something to teach you, I do this because I like do this.
Life is too short to don't use an Apple.

## Ex1 - Simple application 

Very simple application, just a little start, nothing special.

## Ex2 - Swift vs Objective C size comparison

The same application has been written in Obj-C and Swift just to compare the executables sizes. Of course Swift application are bigger, how bigger they are is actually a surprise.
